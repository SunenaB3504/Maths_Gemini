# Clear Path Trail 🌿

## Subtraction Without Regrouping

On this trail, we'll learn how to subtract large numbers when each digit in the top number is larger than (or equal to) the digit below it. This is like walking on a clear path without needing to climb over obstacles!

### The Clear Path Method 🐘

When subtracting large numbers:
1. Line up the numbers by place value
2. Start from the right (ones place)
3. Subtract each column separately

### Safari Example 🦓

Ranger Maya counted 9,67,143 trees in the safari park. After a storm, 7,52,968 trees remained standing. How many trees fell during the storm?

To solve this, we need to subtract 7,52,968 from 9,67,143.

```
  Place value: L  TTh Th H T O
               9  6   7  1 4 3
             - 7  5   2  9 6 8
             -------------------
               2  1   4  2 7 5
```

Let's subtract column by column:
- Ones: 3 - 8 = ? Oops! We need regrouping here. This isn't a clear path!

Let's try a better example:

Ranger Maya counted 8,75,932 animals in the safari park last year. This year, she counted 4,52,821 animals. How many more animals were there last year?

```
  Place value: L  TTh Th H T O
               8  7   5  9 3 2
             - 4  5   2  8 2 1
             -------------------
               4  2   3  1 1 1
```

Let's subtract column by column:
- Ones: 2 - 1 = 1
- Tens: 3 - 2 = 1
- Hundreds: 9 - 8 = 1
- Thousands: 5 - 2 = 3
- Ten Thousands: 7 - 5 = 2
- Lakhs: 8 - 4 = 4

So the difference is 4,23,111 animals.

### Your Safari Challenge 🦏

1. The safari park has 6,54,872 acres of land. 2,43,561 acres are forests. How many acres are not forests?

2. Last month, the safari conservation fund had ₹9,87,500. They spent ₹3,45,200 on new projects. How much money remains?

3. A wildlife census counted 5,83,921 birds in the region. Of these, 2,71,810 were migratory birds. How many were permanent residents?
