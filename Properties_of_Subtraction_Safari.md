# Safari Rules 📜

## Properties of Subtraction

Every safari has important rules to follow! Similarly, subtraction follows special properties that help us solve problems more easily. Let's discover these jungle rules!

### Safari Rule #1: The Zero Rule 🦓

**When you subtract zero from any number, the number stays the same!**

```
Any Number - 0 = That Same Number
```

#### Safari Examples:
- The safari guide spotted 89,764 birds. If 0 birds flew away, how many remained? 
  89,764 - 0 = 89,764 birds!

- The safari park has 96,543 trees. If 0 trees are cut down, how many remain?
  96,543 - 0 = 96,543 trees!

- The safari conservation fund has ₹1,89,536. If ₹0 is spent, how much remains?
  1,89,536 - 0 = 1,89,536 rupees!

#### Your Turn:
1. Fill in the blank: _______ - 0 = 32,59,076
2. If a safari park has 47,085 visitors and 0 leave early, how many visitors remain?

### Safari Rule #2: The Self Rule 🦁

**When you subtract a number from itself, the answer is always zero!**

```
Any Number - That Same Number = 0
```

#### Safari Examples:
- If 865 elephants entered the park and all 865 elephants left, how many remain?
  865 - 865 = 0 elephants!

- If the safari collected ₹96,573 and spent all ₹96,573, how much is left?
  96,573 - 96,573 = 0 rupees!

- If 18,345 tourists came and all 18,345 tourists went home, how many remain?
  18,345 - 18,345 = 0 tourists!

#### Your Turn:
1. Fill in the blank: _______ - 5361 = 0
2. If the safari park had 47,601 liters of water and used 47,601 liters, how much water remains?

### Safari Rule #3: The Predecessor Rule 🐘

**When you subtract 1 from a number, you get the number that comes just before it!**

```
Any Number - 1 = The Previous Number
```

#### Safari Examples:
- If there were 78,600 trees in the safari and 1 tree fell, how many remain?
  78,600 - 1 = 78,599 trees!

- If 40,853 animals were counted and 1 escaped, how many remain?
  40,853 - 1 = 40,852 animals!

- If the safari fund had ₹4,56,390 and spent ₹1, how much is left?
  4,56,390 - 1 = 4,56,389 rupees!

#### Your Turn:
1. Fill in the blank: 68,654 - 1 = _______
2. Fill in the blank: _______ - 1 = 20,000
3. Fill in the blank: 3,91,865 - _______ = 2,91,865
