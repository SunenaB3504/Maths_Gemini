## Solving for Unknown Numbers in the Jungle

In our safari, we sometimes encounter mysterious numbers hiding in the shadows! Can you help us find these unknown numbers in our subtraction puzzles?

### The Mystery Number Method 🦊

To find an unknown number in a subtraction problem:
1. Identify what you know and what you're looking for
2. Use the relationship between subtraction and addition
3. Remember: Difference = Minuend - Subtrahend
   - If you know the difference and subtrahend, then: Minuend = Difference + Subtrahend
   - If you know the difference and minuend, then: Subtrahend = Minuend - Difference

### Safari Example #1: The Hidden Waterfall 🌊

**Jungle Scenario:** Park rangers know that when they subtract 2,34,645 from a mystery number, they get 4,29,160. What is this mystery number?

**Solution:**
- Let's call the mystery number x
- We know: x - 2,34,645 = 4,29,160
- To find x: x = 4,29,160 + 2,34,645 = 6,63,805

The mystery number is 6,63,805.
