## Finding Missing Digits in Subtraction

Oh no! Some animals have walked across our subtraction problems and their paw prints have covered up some of the digits! Can you help us find the missing numbers?

### How to Track Missing Digits 🦁

To find missing digits in subtraction:
1. Look for clues in the visible digits
2. Try different values and check if they work
3. Remember regrouping rules when necessary

### Safari Example #1: Lion Tracks 🐾

```
  _ 5 3 11 8
- 1 3 5 9 3 5
------------
  3 1 _ _ 5 3
```

Let's find the missing paw prints step by step:

1. First, let's examine the ones place:
   - We have 8 - 5 = 3 ✓ This matches!

2. For the tens place:
   - We have 1 - 3 = ? 
   - This would need regrouping, and the answer digit is 5
   - So after regrouping, we'd have 11 - 3 = 8 ✓

3. For the hundreds place:
   - We need a number that when subtracted from 3 gives 7
   - So the missing digit in the answer is 7
   - 3 - ? = 7 is impossible without regrouping
   - This means there was regrouping from thousands place

4. For the thousands place:
   - We have 5 - 9 = ? (with regrouping from ten thousands)
   - After regrouping: 15 - 9 = 6 ✓
   
5. For the ten thousands place:
   - We have ? - 3 = 1
   - So the missing digit in the top number is 4
   - 4 - 3 = 1 ✓

6. For the hundred thousands place:
   - We have ? - 1 = 3
   - So the missing digit in the top number is 4
   - 4 - 1 = 3 ✓

The completed subtraction is:
```
  4 5 3 11 8
- 1 3 5 9 3 5
------------
  3 1 7 6 5 3
```

### Safari Example #2: Tiger Tracks 🐯

```
    _ 6 4 _
-   2 _ 3
---------
    3 _ 1
```

Let's solve this step by step:

1. The ones place:
   - We have ? - 3 = 1
   - So the missing digit on top is 4
   - 4 - 3 = 1 ✓

2. The tens place:
   - We have 4 - ? = ?
   - The answer is missing, but we know that 4 minus something must give us a single digit
   - Testing numbers: If the middle digit is 0, then 4 - 0 = 4
   - But if it's 1, then 4 - 1 = 3
   - Let's try 1 for now and verify later

3. The hundreds place:
   - We have 6 - 2 = ?
   - 6 - 2 = 4 ✓

4. The thousands place:
   - We have ? - 0 = 3
   - So the missing digit on top is 3
   - 3 - 0 = 3 ✓

Let's verify our entire solution:
```
    3 6 4 4
-   2 1 3
---------
    3 4 1
```
Yes, this works! 3644 - 213 = 3431.

### Your Safari Tracking Challenges 🐘

1. ```
     7 3 9 _ 5
   - _ 6 2 _
   ---------
     _ 7 _ 0 5
   ```

2. ```
     _ 0 0 0 1 0
   - 4 3 _ 8
