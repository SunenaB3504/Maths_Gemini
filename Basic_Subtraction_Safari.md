# Jungle Introduction 🌴

## Welcome to the Start of Your Safari!

Before we venture deeper into the jungle, let's understand what subtraction really means!

### Safari Story 🦒

**Ranger Namya** is leading a safari tour. She spent ₹1050 on supplies for the journey. After the tour, she received:
- Five ₹500 notes = ₹2500
- Three ₹100 notes = ₹300
- Two ₹50 notes = ₹100

**Safari Question:** How much did Ranger Namya earn from the tour?

**Jungle Hint:** To find Namya's earning, we need to:
1. Add all the money she received: ₹2500 + ₹300 + ₹100 = ₹2900
2. Subtract what she spent: ₹2900 - ₹1050 = ₹1850

So Ranger Namya earned ₹1850 from the safari tour!

### Safari Number Patterns 🔢

Sometimes numbers follow a pattern, even when we subtract! Let's look for some patterns in the jungle.

**Pattern Example 1:** A troop of monkeys is eating bananas. They start with 20 bananas. Every hour they eat 3.
- Hour 0: 20 bananas
- Hour 1: 20 - 3 = 17 bananas
- Hour 2: 17 - 3 = 14 bananas
- Hour 3: 14 - 3 = 11 bananas
*The pattern is subtracting 3 each time.* What comes next? (11 - 3 = 8)

**Pattern Example 2:** A river is drying up in the heat. It starts 100 cm deep. Each day it gets 5 cm shallower.
- Day 1: 100 cm
- Day 2: 100 - 5 = 95 cm
- Day 3: 95 - 5 = 90 cm
- Day 4: 90 - 5 = 85 cm
*The pattern is subtracting 5 each time.* How deep will it be on Day 5? (85 - 5 = 80 cm)

**Pattern Example 3:** A safari jeep starts with a full tank of 60 litres. It uses 10 litres every 100 km.
- Start: 60 litres
- After 100 km: 60 - 10 = 50 litres
- After 200 km: 50 - 10 = 40 litres
- After 300 km: 40 - 10 = 30 litres
*The pattern is subtracting 10 each time.* How much fuel is left after 400 km? (30 - 10 = 20 litres)

**Pattern Example 4:** Find the missing numbers:
- 50, 45, 40, ___, 30, ___ (Subtracting 5: 35, 25)
- 112, 102, ___, 82, ___, 62 (Subtracting 10: 92, 72)
- 99, 88, 77, ___, ___, 44 (Subtracting 11: 66, 55)

Can you spot other subtraction patterns on your safari?

### What is Subtraction? 🐾

Subtraction is finding what remains after taking away some amount. 

Think of it like this:
- If you see 8 elephants at the watering hole and 3 walk away, how many remain? 8 - 3 = 5 elephants!
- If your safari vehicle travels 50 kilometers of a 120-kilometer journey, how much further must you go? 120 - 50 = 70 kilometers!

### Your Turn! 🦁

1. A safari guide spotted 124 animals yesterday. Today, he spotted 76 animals. How many fewer animals did he spot today?

2. A safari park had 256 visitors on Saturday. On Sunday, it had 189 visitors. What was the difference in the number of visitors?

3. A wildlife photographer had 450 photos. She deleted 67 blurry ones. How many photos does she have now?
