# Borrowing Bridge üåâ

## Subtraction With Regrouping

Sometimes on our safari, we encounter rivers that need crossing! In subtraction, when a digit on top is smaller than the digit below it, we need to "borrow" or "regroup" from the next place value - just like crossing a special bridge to get help from neighboring numbers!

### The Borrowing Bridge Method üêä

When a digit in the top number is smaller than the digit below:
1. Borrow 1 from the next place value to the left
2. Add 10 to the current digit
3. Now subtract the bottom digit from this new value

### Safari Example ü¶è

The safari park recorded 7,52,717 visitors last year. This year, they recorded 4,24,899 visitors. How many fewer visitors came this year?

We need to find: 7,52,717 - 4,24,899

```
    Place value: L  TTh Th H T O
                 7  5   2  7 1 7
               - 4  2   4  8 9 9
```

Let's cross the Borrowing Bridge step by step:

**Step 1: Ones Place**
7 - 9 = ? We can't do this directly! We need to borrow.
- Borrow 1 from the tens place (1 becomes 0)
- Add 10 to the ones place: 7 + 10 = 17
- Now subtract: 17 - 9 = 8

```
    Place value: L  TTh Th H T O
                 7  5   2  7 0 17
               - 4  2   4  8 9 9
                               8
```

**Step 2: Tens Place**
After borrowing, we have 0 tens - 9 tens = ? 
We need to borrow again!
- Borrow 1 from the hundreds place (7 becomes 6)
- Add 10 to the tens place: 0 + 10 = 10
- Now subtract: 10 - 9 = 1

```
    Place value: L  TTh Th H T O
                 7  5   2  6 10 17
               - 4  2   4  8 9  9
                             1  8
```

**Step 3: Hundreds Place**
6 - 8 = ? We need to borrow again!
- Borrow 1 from the thousands place (2 becomes 1)
- Add 10 to hundreds place: 6 + 10 = 16
- Now subtract: 16 - 8 = 8

```
    Place value: L  TTh Th H  T  O
                 7  5   1  16 10 17
               - 4  2   4  8  9  9
                          8  1  8
```

**Step 4: Thousands Place**
1 - 4 = ? We need to borrow again!
- Borrow 1 from the ten thousands place (5 becomes 4)
- Add 10 to thousands place: 1 + 10 = 11
- Now subtract: 11 - 4 = 7

```
    Place value: L  TTh Th  H  T  O
                 7  4   11  16 10 17
               - 4  2   4   8  9  9
                      7   8  1  8
```

**Step 5: Ten Thousands Place**
4 - 2 = 2

**Step 6: Lakhs Place**
7 - 4 = 3

```
    Place value: L  TTh Th  H  T  O
                 7  4   11  16 10 17
               - 4  2   4   8  9  9
                 3  2   7   8  1  8
```

So the difference is 3,27,818 visitors.

### Your Safari Challenge ü¶ì

1. A safari conservation project started with 8,34,526 rare plants. After a disease, only 3,65,738 plants survived. How many plants were lost?

2. The safari park recorded 6,35,042 animal sounds last month. This month, they recorded 2,78,195 sounds. What is the decrease in recorded sounds?

3. The safari park collected 9,00,000 liters of rainwater. They used 4,53,678 liters for the animals. How much rainwater is left?
