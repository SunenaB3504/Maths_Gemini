# Jungle Problems 🌿

## Real-World Safari Challenges

In the wild, we face many challenges that require subtraction skills! Let's solve these safari word problems together.

### Safari Distance Challenge 🚙

**Jungle Scenario:** Ranger Naveen and his father were traveling to a remote safari camp 178 kilometers from their base. After driving for 95 kilometers, their jeep got stuck in the mud.

**Safari Question:** How much further do they have to go to reach the camp?

**Solution:**
- Total distance to camp = 178 km
- Distance already traveled = 95 km
- Distance remaining = 178 - 95 = 83 km

Ranger Naveen and his father still need to travel 83 kilometers to reach the safari camp.

### Safari Conservation Challenge 💰

**Jungle Scenario:** A conservation team spent ₹5400 on a solar-powered water pump for the animals. They received ₹2900 as a grant from a wildlife organization.

**Safari Question:** How much did the conservation team spend from their own funds?

**Solution:**
- Total cost of water pump = ₹5400
- Grant received = ₹2900
- Amount spent from own funds = ₹5400 - ₹2900 = ₹2500

The conservation team spent ₹2500 from their own funds.

### Safari Decoration Challenge 🌸

**Jungle Scenario:** For a wildlife photography exhibition that was to be attended by 750 people, the decorators had to place 1,250 native flowers around the venue. They had already placed 985 flowers.

**Safari Question:** How many more flowers do they need to place?

**Solution:**
- Total flowers needed = 1,250
- Flowers already placed = 985
- Additional flowers needed = 1,250 - 985 = 265

The decorators need to place 265 more flowers.

### Safari Survey Challenge 👓

**Jungle Scenario:** A survey of three safari groups shows that 2953 out of 4000 tourists wear sunglasses during the safari.

**Safari Question:** How many tourists do not wear sunglasses?

**Solution:**
- Total number of tourists = 4000
- Tourists wearing sunglasses = 2953
- Tourists not wearing sunglasses = 4000 - 2953 = 1047

1047 tourists do not wear sunglasses.

### Safari Savings Challenge 💵

**Jungle Scenario:** Raj, a wildlife photographer, has to save ₹5,00,000 for a new camera. He has already saved ₹2,85,925.

**Safari Question:** How much more should he save?

**Solution:**
- Total amount needed = ₹5,00,000
- Amount already saved = ₹2,85,925
- Amount still to save = ₹5,00,000 - ₹2,85,925 = ₹2,14,075

Raj needs to save ₹2,14,075 more for his camera.

### Safari Stadium Challenge 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

**Jungle Scenario:** A large wildlife theater can hold 3,25,000 people. On a particular day, there were 2,19,880 people; out of which 78,655 were children.

**Safari Questions:**
1. How many adults were there?
2. How many seats were vacant?

**Solution:**
1. Total people present = 2,19,880
   Children present = 78,655
   Adults present = 2,19,880 - 78,655 = 1,41,225
   
2. Total capacity = 3,25,000
   People present = 2,19,880
   Vacant seats = 3,25,000 - 2,19,880 = 1,05,120

There were 1,41,225 adults and 1,05,120 vacant seats.
